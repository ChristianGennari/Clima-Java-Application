# Clima-Java-Application

This is my first app in which i use API:s.
It shows the current weather where you are located by tracking your device via GPS, but there is also an option
to manually enter desired city and see the weather. There is no weather prediction!

The Clima weather app is an application created as a school project in the beginning of 2019.
